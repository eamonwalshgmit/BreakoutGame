CContinuous Assessment (Lab) exams are not currently handled by the Guru system and all CA material should be sent directly to your extern, preferably using Filesender https://filesender.heanet.ie/ - please use the appropriate encryption password for your extern. I’ve spoken to Jackie and Laura and theoretically there is no reason why Guru couldn’t handle the CA lab exam material, at least for the paper itself (other material may be electronic i.e. on Moodle) and it would be more appropriate to use Guru as it’s the preferred and most secure method of securing exam material.
